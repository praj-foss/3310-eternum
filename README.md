3310 Eternum
===

A place where I can keep experimenting with my 
[Nokia 3310](https://lpcwiki.miraheze.org/wiki/Nokia_3310_(2017)) forever!

### Building

JDK 8 is necessary to compile these. Download and install one for your OS from the
[Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=8&package=jdk) releases.

Once JDK is installed, use the following command to build:

```shell
./gradlew :example:jar
```

To emulate the jars locally, use [MicroEmulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/microemulator/)

#### Thanks!
